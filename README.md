# Image Classification Project

Welcome to the Image Classification Project! In this project, we explore various aspects of image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We delve into data preparation, model training, evaluation, and analysis to gain insights into the classification process.

## Task Overview

### 0. Data Preparation
   - Download the SVHN Dataset (Format 2) and split it into train, validation, and test sets.
   - Visualize the data distribution across class labels for training and validation sets.

### 1. Training a CNN from Scratch
   - Design and implement a CNN architecture with 2 Convolution Layers.
   - Train the model using Cross-Entropy Loss and ReLU activation functions.
   - Log training and validation losses and accuracies using WandB.
   - Evaluate model performance on the test set, report Accuracy, F1-Score, and visualize the confusion matrix.
   - Analyze misclassifications and their possible reasons.

### 2. Fine-tuning a Pretrained Model
   - Fine-tune a ResNet-18 architecture pretrained on ImageNet.
   - Log training and validation losses and accuracies using WandB.
   - Evaluate model performance on the test set, report Accuracy, F1-Score, and visualize the confusion matrix.
   - Visualize feature representations using t-SNE plots in 2D and 3D space.

### 3. Data Augmentation Techniques
   - Apply data augmentation techniques suitable for image classification tasks.
   - Train models using augmented data and evaluate performance metrics.
   - Report Accuracy, F1-Score, and visualize the confusion matrix.

### 5. Bonus: Misclassification Analysis
   - Analyze misclassified images using Euclidean distances in feature space.
   - Compare distances from ground truth class centroids to predicted class centroids across models.

### 6. Model Comparison
   - Compare and comment on the performance of all three models.

## Highlights
- **Misclassification Analysis:** Gain insights into why models misclassify certain images.
- **t-SNE Visualization:** Explore feature representations in 2D and 3D space to understand data clustering.

Stay tuned for updates and insights as we progress through the project!
